# Data Science Portfolio

This repository is home to some of my data science and machine learning projects.

The examples here showcase different approaches to machine learning using Python and R. I also use Python, R, and a little JavaScript to visualize the results of these different projects.
There are technical annotations with each notebook to help tell the story of what each project is trying to achieve.

I try to extensively comment my code but I'll let you be the judge of whether that makes it explainable.  Enjoy!
